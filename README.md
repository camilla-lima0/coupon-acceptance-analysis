# [Project Name]: Coupon Acceptance Analysis
Required Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon? 

## Overview
Jupyter notebook with analysis on the data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It's the result of a survey ran by 'Amazon Mechanical Turk' outlining the profile of different drivers and if they accepeted a coupon for a nearby local business (restaurants, cafes).
The analysis focus on understanding which atributes indicate a higher or lower coupon acceptance rate 

### Key Findings
* Overall acceptance rate is high at 56.8%
* Coupon Type and Time of the day appears to be the most relevant attributes:
* Also noted that passagenrs with kids are more likely to accept a coupon (59% acceptance rate)
 * Overall the coupon strategy appears to be successful and with some fine tuning on audience type, it can be even more successful. My recommendation would be to focus only on Carry out & Take away / Restaurants (>20).
